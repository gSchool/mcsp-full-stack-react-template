# Full-Stack React Example

This repo contains an example of a full-stack application with an express backend and a React frontend.

It uses vite as the module bundler and dotenv for configuration. It's organized as a mono-repo using [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces) which allows us to have our client and server in one repo.

> **Note**: When you run `npm install` at the root, it will install all dependencies listed in `package.json`, `server/package.json`, and `client/package.json`.

## Customizing the Template

1. Create new repo using this one as a template.
1. Pull that repo down.
1. Update `./server/migration.sql` to the schema for your application.

## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
1. Create your database: `createdb YOUR_DB`
1. Run your migrations: `psql -f server/migration.sql YOUR_DB`
1. Create your `.env` file: `cp .env.template .env`
1. Add your info in `.env`
1. Run the app: `npm run dev`
